                        <p>Hi! Our names are Reanna and Xuan. We’re both from Computing for All or CFA and worked on this game to educate users on the effects of climate change everywhere. From June 26 to June 28, 2021, Seattle broke its previous heat record, at a record breaking 104 degrees Fahrenheit with the highest being around 111 degrees Fahrenheit. This poses a more specific threat of (topic). Around the world, we’re all experiencing extreme weather such as storms; a recent example was the extreme storm which is linked to the massive flood that happened in Germany. A majority of this extreme weather is happening due to climate change, and will continue to turn for the worst if we don’t all put in our part to reduce climate change as much as possible. Some ways we can reduce climate change include learning how to properly sort and recycle plastics, composting, plant, and simply raising awareness for this growing issue!</p>
